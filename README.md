# Welcome To Scale Manager
This app is for [Headscale](https://github.com/juanfont/headscale) users who want to manage their server via HTTP/HTTPS without 
needing a Web UI or using Headscales gRPC.

This simple but useful app allows you to manage multiple headscale servers, their 
pre-auth keys, users, API keys, devices, device registration and more all with one app.
